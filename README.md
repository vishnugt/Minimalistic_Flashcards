# Minimalistic_Flashcards
A self hostable minimalistic flashcard app that takes the data in csv format


All you need to do is change the data.csv file and host it in your apache/nginx server.

You can also try it out at [jflash.redsnow.in](https://jflash.redsnow.in/)

Your csv can have more than 1 comma:  Contents before first comma will become the question, and everything after the first comma will become the answer
